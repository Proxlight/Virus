# Create Virus Using Python

## Introduction

Hi everyoneüëã, Sometimes we find our files infected with a computer virus. In this tutorial, we will get introduced to the concept of a virus by writing a simple one in Python.

First thing first, let‚Äôs get introduced to the definition of a computer virus. A virus is a typical malware program that infects a particular type of file or most files by injecting data or code. It tries to list files in all directories and then inject typical data/code in those files.

The point to be noted; a virus does not replicate itself. It just continuously infects all files in the directories/folders. The malware that replicates itself and consumes hard disk space is typically called a Worm.

You can refer to my YouTube video to see a working tutorial for better understanding and a step-by-step guide of the same.

## Requirements

To write a simple virus, we will use the following modules.

os, datetime, pathlib, time

### os module

Here, module os is the most important one as it will help us to list all the files along with the absolute path. An absolute path starts with the root directory /.

An absolute path is necessary here as while working with numerous files you must know the exact location. Using filenames only, your script does not know where to look for that files.

### pathlib module

Here, we use pathlib to retrieve the extension of a file. It can be done in multiple ways though, so you may not find this module necessary at all.
datetime and time

datetime and time is used only for the start time of execution. If you want the script to start working right now, you may not need these modules as well.
